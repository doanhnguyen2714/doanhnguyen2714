# 💫About Me :
Hi 👋, I'm Nguyễn Chấn Nam Doanh

A passionate software developer from Vietnam. Possesses strong business and data analytics skills. Always eager to learn and persistent.

🔭 I’m currently working on Administrative Office of the Faculty of Information Technology

🌱 I’m currently learning about data analysis tools, IT service management (ITSM), and maybe a bit of Python or R for automation — always expanding my tech and admin skill set.

👯 I’m looking for opportunities to collaborate in solving business problems.

🤝 I’m looking for help with connecting with professionals in tech education, IT administration, or business analytics — and learning best practices for digital workflow optimization.

💬 Ask me about IT faculty operations, academic support systems, digital tools for administration, or bridging tech and education.

⚡ Fun fact I once helped organize a 24-hour hackathon for IT students — chaos, creativity, and coffee included! ☕🧘
